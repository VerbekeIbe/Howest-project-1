# Howest-project-1 - HeartBeats
This repository contains all the code for my end of year project for the first year of Multimedia & Creative Technologies at Howest Kortrijk. (Conveniently named ‘Project One’).

We were given the assignment to ‘hack’ a device of our choice and make it useful to someone in the IoT-Field. (That someone could very well be ourselves for the purpose of fun/entertainment). We were also required to make a fitting web application to control our device and use at least one LCD screen to display the device’s IP-address. The whole project would be configured and run from a Raspberry Pi.

I chose not to hack any physical device, but rather ‘hack’ the concept of an iPod or mp3-player. I wanted to read out a user’s heartrate and use that data as a determining factor on what music the person was listening to. I also wanted to further analyze the data to capture ‘trends’ in people’s heartrate (e.g. when someone’s heartrate speeds up over time, the music should follow that trend at the same rate).

The result of this project is HeartBeats. The backend of the project runs on python and the frontend is a legacy web app (HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS). The data is stored in an SQL database that connects to the backend. 
This project gives a pretty good idea of all the technologies and skills that we have learned during our first year at MCT.
